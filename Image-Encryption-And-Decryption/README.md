Here's a simple Python script using the Pillow library to perform basic image encryption and decryption using pixel manipulation. 
This script defines two functions: encrypt_image and decrypt_image. The encrypt_image function takes an image file path and a key as input, encrypts the image using a simple XOR operation with the key on each pixel, and saves the encrypted image.
The decrypt_image function takes the path of the encrypted image and the same key used for encryption, decrypts the image, and saves the decrypted image. 
You can change the key value to customize the encryption and decryption process.
