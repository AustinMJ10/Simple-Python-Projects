Here's a simple Python script that assesses the strength of a password based on length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. 
It provides feedback to the user on the password strength. You can run this script, and after entering a password, it will provide feedback on its strength based on the defined criteria. 
You can adjust the criteria or add more checks as needed.
