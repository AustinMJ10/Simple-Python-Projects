Developing a packet sniffer allows you to intercept and analyze network traffic, gaining insights into the communication between devices.

Install Dependencies: First, ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the scapy library using pip install scapy. Create Your Packet Sniffer: Below is a simple example of a packet sniffer that captures and displays relevant information from network packets. Explanation: The script captures packets with an IP layer (IPv4 or IPv6). It identifies whether the packet uses TCP, UDP, or another protocol. Displays source and destination IP addresses, along with protocol details. If applicable, it also shows source and destination port numbers.

Run the Sniffer: Save the script as packet_sniffer.py and run it using python packet_sniffer.py. Adjust the filter ("ip" in this case) and customize the output as needed.

Remember that packet sniffing can have legal and ethical implications. Always use such tools responsibly and with proper authorization.

For more advanced features, consider using tools like Wireshark or tcpdump12. These tools provide richer functionality and detailed analysis capabilities for network traffic.
